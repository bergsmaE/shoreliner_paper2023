    abstract = {Climatologic and anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas affect the coastal zone at different scales. With the development of new missions in open-access, satellites now represent an attractive solution for a broad public to capture local-scale coastal impacts at large scales. Here, the capability of the Sentinel 2 constellation to cover coastal areas and measure coastal processes –physical and biological. We show that Sentinel 2 enables high-frequency measurements across the globe. Cloud coverage at higher latitudes is overcome by decrease revisit time-intervals. Only around the equator, the longest revisit intervals and high cloud cover probability limits coastal measurements there. Sentinel 2 based methods are capable of estimating Digital Elevation Models for mid- to high-latitude coastal zones and sporadic spots for lower latitudes where 2 orbit swaths overlap. For the majority of the world’s coastal bathymetries can be obtained with the Sentinel 2 imagery surpassing the depth of closure (beyond this offshore limit sediment transport is limited). Only in sheltered areas, wave-based bathymetry inversion is limited but at these areas inversion through colouring (light penetration) prevails. This works shows that Sentinel 2 enables coastal monitoring as never before, large spatial scale with revisits of a few days at most of the world.}

    abstract = {Analysis of shoreline change is fundamental to a broad range of investigations undertaken by coastal scientists, coastal engineers, and coastal managers. Multispectral Satellite Imagery (MSI) provides high resolution datasets that allow coastlines to be monitored more frequently and on a global scale. The Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI datasets are free for public use, which has increased the frequency of studies focusing on coastal change using satellite imagery. However, despite access to global and free satellite imagery, a method has yet to be developed to monitor different shoreline types and indicators globally, as not all shorelines are sandy beaches, and the waterline cannot be representative of all shoreline changes. The review paper introduces different techniques used currently to extract shoreline features, including water indexing, Machine Learning (ML) and segmentation methods. We presented here a comprehensive review of range of the methods available for shoreline extraction from MSI and discuss why some shoreline features have been identified using multispectral satellite imagery and others not. This approach helps to signal where the gaps are on the current methods for shoreline extraction and provides a roadmap of the key challenges that prevents MSI to be used for understanding shoreline changes at a global scale.}

The toolkit exploits the capabilities of Google Earth Engine to efficiently retrieve Landsat and Sentinel-2 images cropped to any user-defined region of interest. The resulting images are pre-processed to remove cloudy pixels and enhance spatial resolution, before applying a robust and generic shoreline detection algorithm. This novel shoreline detection technique combines a supervised image classification and a sub-pixel resolution border segmentation to map the position of the shoreline with an accuracy of ~10 m. The purpose of CoastSat is to provide coastal managers, engineers and scientists a user-friendly and practical toolkit to monitor and explore their coastlines.

    abstract = {The ability to repeatedly observe and quantify the changing position of the shoreline is key to present-day coastal management and future coastal planning. This study evaluates the capability of satellite remote sensing to resolve at differing temporal scales the variability and trends in shoreline position along sandy coastlines. Shorelines are extracted from 30 + years of publicly available satellite imagery and compared to long-term in-situ measurements at 5 diverse test sites in Europe, Australia, the USA and New Zealand. These sites span a range of different beach characteristics including wave energy and tide range as well as timescales of observed shoreline variability, from strongly seasonal (e.g., Truc Vert, France), to storm-dominated (e.g., Narrabeen-Collaroy, Australia), to only minor annual to multi-annual signals (e.g., Duck, USA). For the 5 sites, the observed typical horizontal errors varied between a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 7.3 m and 12.7 m. An analysis of the typical magnitudes of shoreline variability at temporal scales ranging from a single month up to 10 years indicates that, by the implementation of targeted image pre-processing then the application of a robust sub-pixel shoreline extraction technique, the resulting satellite-derived shorelines are generally able to resolve (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) the observed shoreline variance at timescales of 6 months and longer. The only exception to this is along coastlines where minimal annual to multi-annual shoreline variability occurs (e.g. Duck, USA); at these sites decadal-scale variations are successfully captured. The results of this analysis demonstrate that satellite-derived shorelines spanning the past 30 years as well as into the future can be used to explore and quantify intra- and inter-annual shoreline behaviour at a wide range of beaches around the world. Moreover, it is demonstrated that present-day satellite observations are also capable of capturing event-scale shoreline changes (e.g. individual storms) that occur at timescales shorter than 6 months, where this rapid response exceeds the typical magnitude of shoreline variability. Finally, several practical coastal engineering applications are presented, demonstrating the use of freely-available satellite imagery to monitor inter-annual embayed beach rotation, rapid storm-induced shoreline retreat and a major sand nourishment.}

    ABSTRACT = {The intertidal zones are well recognized for their dynamic nature and role in near-shore hydrodynamics. The intertidal topography is poorly mapped worldwide due to the high cost of associated field campaigns. Here we present a combination of remote-sensing and hydrodynamic modeling to overcome the lack of in situ measurements. We derive a digital elevation model (DEM) by linking the corresponding water level to a sample of shorelines at various stages of the tide. Our shoreline detection method is fully automatic and capable of processing high-resolution imagery from state-of-the-art satellite missions, e.g., Sentinel-2. We demonstrate the use of a tidal model to infer the corresponding water level in each shoreline pixel at the sampled timestamp. As a test case, this methodology is applied to the vast coastal region of the Bengal delta and an intertidal DEM at 10 m resolution covering an area of 1134 km 2 is developed from Sentinel-2 imagery. We assessed the quality of the DEM with two independent in situ datasets and conclude that the accuracy of our DEM amounts to about 1.5 m, which is commensurate with the typical error bar of the validation datasets. This DEM can be useful for high-resolution hydrodynamic and wave modeling of the near-shore area. Additionally, being automatic and numerically effective, our methodology is compliant with near-real-time monitoring constraints.},

    abstract = {In the face of global population growth and the uneven distribution of water supply, a better knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is critical. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of ongoing processes, which addresses the intricate nature of water surfaces and allows an assessment of the pressures placed on aquatic ecosystems. However, the main challenge in identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data is the high variability of spectral signatures, both in space and time. In the last 10years only a few operational methods have been proposed to map or monitor surface water at continental or global scale, and each of them show limitations. The objectives of this study are to develop, demonstrate and validate the adequacy of a generic multi-temporal and multi-spectral image analysis method to detect water surfaces automatically, and to monitor them in near real-time at the African continental scale as a first step towards global scale coverage. The proposed approach, based on a transformation of the RGB color space into HSV, provides dynamic information at the continental scale. Two different validations were done at the continental scale over Africa: i) The algorithm validation checked the ability of the proposed algorithm to perform as effectively as human interpretation of the image: it showed an accuracy of 96.6\% and no commission errors. ii) The product validation was carried out by using an independent dataset derived from high resolution imagery: the continental permanent water surface product showed an accuracy of 91.5\% and few commission errors. Potential applications of the proposed method have been identified and discussed. The methodology that has been developed is generic: it can be applied to sensors with similar bands with good reliability, and minimal effort. Moreover, this experiment at the African continental scale showed that the methodology is efficient for a large range of environmental conditions. Additional preliminary tests over other continents indicate that the proposed methodology could also be applied at the global scale without too many difficulties.}

    abstract = {Measured trends and variability in shoreline position are used by coastal managers, scientists and engineers to understand and monitor coastal systems. This paper presents a new and generic method for automated shoreline detection from the largely unexplored collection of publicly available satellite imagery. The position of the obtained Satellite Derived Shoreline (SDS) is tested for accuracy for 143 images against high resolution in-situ data along a coastal stretch near the Sand Motor, a well-documented mega-scale nourishment along the Dutch coast. In this assessment, we quantify the effects of potential inaccuracy drivers such as the presence of clouds and wave-induced foam. The overall aim of this study is to verify whether the SDS is suitable to study structural coastline trends for coastal engineering practice. In the ideal case of a cloud free satellite image without the presence of waves, with limited morphological changes between the time of image acquisition and the date of the in-situ measurement, the accuracy of the SDS is with subpixel precision (smaller than 10–30 m, depending on the satellite mission) and depends on intertidal beach slope and image pixel resolution. For the highest resolution images we find an average offset of 1 m between the SDS position and the in-situ shoreline in the considered domain. The accuracy deteriorates in the presence of clouds and/or waves on the image, satellite sensor corrections and georeferencing errors. The case study showed that especially the presence of clouds can lead to a considerable seaward offset of the SDS of multiple pixels (e.g. order 200 m). Wave-induced foam results in seaward offsets in the order of 40 m. These effects can largely be overcome by creating composite images, which results in a continuous dataset with subpixel precision (10–30 m, depending on the satellite mission). This implies that structural trends can be detected for coastlines that have changed with at least the pixel resolution within the considered timespan. Given the accuracy of composite images along the Sand Motor in combination with the worldwide availability of public satellite imagery covering the last decades, this technique can potentially be applied at other locations with large (structural) coastline trends.}
